# üéµ Music Store Sales Analysis using SQL

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates practical SQL skills by analyzing a digital music store's data to derive actionable business insights. Using real-world relational data, I performed in-depth analysis on customer behavior, sales trends, and artist performance to support data-driven decision-making for marketing and operations.

>  **Focus**: Revenue analysis, genre preferences, customer segmentation, and top-performing artists.

## Techniques and SQL Concepts

This project showcases the use of diverse SQL techniques and concepts, including:

- **Basic Queries**: Data extraction, filtering, and sorting.
- **Aggregations**: `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, and `GROUP BY` to summarize data.
- **Window Functions**: `RANK`, `ROW_NUMBER`, and `CUME_DIST` for advanced analytical insights.
- **Joins**: Combining data across multiple tables for comprehensive analysis.
- **Subqueries and CTEs**: Structuring complex queries for better readability and efficiency.
- **Date and Time Functions**: Analyzing trends and patterns based on timestamped data.
- **Dynamic Calculations**: Deriving metrics such as percentage contributions, growth rates, and cumulative totals.
